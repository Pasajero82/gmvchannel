Subject: Quick Question: How would you like to be featured on GMV?

Hi [Nombre del Artista],

As we prepare to add [Nombre de la Canción] to our main rotation, I want to ensure we do it in the way that makes you most comfortable.

Our goal is to create a seamless "MTV-style" TV experience while ensuring you get full credit and new fans. We have two ways to do this, and the choice is 100% yours:

OPTION A: Direct Link (We use your YouTube Upload)

How it works: We embed the video directly from your existing YouTube channel.

Pros: 100% of the views count directly towards your channel stats immediately.

The Experience: The video plays exactly as it is on your channel.

Note: If you choose this, the only downside is that if the video has "End Screens" (suggested videos) or "Cards" that pop up, it can break the TV immersion. But if you prefer this method, we fully respect it!

OPTION B: GMV Spotlight Upload (We host the file)

How it works: You send us the file (or we download it with permission) and upload a "Clean Version" to the official GMV Channel.

Pros: It offers the most premium, uninterrupted "TV Experience" (No ads, no pop-ups, no distractions).

Credit & Traffic: We CANNOT and WILL NOT monetize this. YouTube's Content ID system automatically detects it as your work, making it technically impossible for us to earn revenue from it. Instead, we use our interface's permanent "Spotify" and "YouTube" icons to drive viewers to subscribe to you.

Rights: You keep full ownership.

Which option do you prefer? A or B?

Let me know what works best for you!

Best, [Tu Nombre]
